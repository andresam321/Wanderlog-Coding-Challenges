# Wanderlog Practice Challenges

ðŸš¨ **Note:** These problems are **created by me** and are **not copied** from Wanderlogâ€™s actual assessment. They are inspired by the public descriptions Wanderlog provides in their Work at a Startup listing and initial emails, which mention real-world, non-algorithmic JavaScript tasks.

The purpose of this repo is to:
- Practice my JavaScript skills in a realistic setting
- Simulate the type of questions I *might* see on a Wanderlog-style assessment
- Keep a public record of my learning and progress

I built these problems entirely on my own to help sharpen my ability to parse, aggregate, and format structured data â€” which aligns with what the company looks for in engineers.
